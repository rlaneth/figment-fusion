Figment Fusion is a Colab notebook is intended for technology enthusiasts and is
designed to provide insights on the process of running
[Stable Diffusion][stable-diffusion] with the [Diffusers library][diffusers],
allowing for exploration and customization while still remaining simple and fun
to use.

Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art, free and open text-to-image model
created by researchers from [CompVis][compvis] and [Runway][runway], with
support from [Eleuther AI][eleuther-ai], [LAION][laion-ai] and
[Stability AI][stability-ai].

The Diffusers library by Hugging Face is used with inspiration from the
[Stable Diffusion with Diffusers][diffusers-demo] demo.
